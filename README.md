# TicTacToe-Winner-Checker
A little program that checks if there is a winner in a TicTacToe finished game

--HOW DOES IT WORK
The program will ask in input the 9 characters of a TicTacToe game. The characters will be inserted row-wise (a[0][0], a[0][1], a[0][2], a[1][0]...).
For simplicity use 'x' and 'o' as game characters and '#' as space character.
The program DOES NOT have any input-checks, it's just a raw thing written for an excercize with given inputs.

The complexity is O(n^2) because of its input method.
